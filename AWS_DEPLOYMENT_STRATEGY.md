# AWS Deployment Strategy for MigrateAI Backend

## Overview

This document outlines the production deployment strategy for the MigrateAI backend on AWS, using containerized services that closely mirror our development environment.

## Architecture Overview

### Production Stack

- **ECS Fargate** - Container orchestration (serverless)
- **ECR** - Container registry for Docker images
- **RDS PostgreSQL** - Managed database service
- **ElastiCache Redis** - Managed Redis service
- **Application Load Balancer** - Traffic distribution
- **CloudWatch** - Monitoring and logging
- **Secrets Manager** - Secure credential management

### Development vs Production Parity

Our development environment now closely mirrors production:

| Component      | Development          | Production            |
| -------------- | -------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Backend**    | Docker Container     | ECS Fargate Task      |
| **Database**   | PostgreSQL Container | RDS PostgreSQL        |
| **Cache**      | Redis Container      | ElastiCache Redis     |
| **Networking** | Docker Network       | VPC + Security Groups |
| **Secrets**    | .env files           | AWS Secrets Manager   |

## Current Production-Ready Setup

### âœ… What We've Accomplished

1. **Multi-stage Docker Builds**

   - Optimized production images
   - Security best practices (non-root user)
   - Minimal attack surface

2. **Production Docker Compose**

   - Health checks for all services
   - Resource limits and reservations
   - Proper service dependencies
   - Restart policies

3. **Environment Configuration**

   - Production environment variables
   - Secure defaults
   - AWS-ready configuration

4. **AWS Infrastructure Files**
   - ECS Task Definition
   - Deployment scripts
   - ECR integration

## Deployment Process

### 1. Build and Push to ECR

```bash
# Build production image
docker build -f Dockerfile.prod -t migrate-backend:latest .

# Tag for ECR
docker tag migrate-backend:latest $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_REGION.amazonaws.com/migrate-backend:latest

# Push to ECR
docker push $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_REGION.amazonaws.com/migrate-backend:latest
```

### 2. Deploy to ECS

```bash
# Update ECS service
aws ecs update-service \
  --cluster migrate-cluster \
  --service migrate-backend-service \
  --force-new-deployment
```

### 3. Infrastructure as Code (Future)

We'll implement Terraform or AWS CDK for:

- VPC and networking
- ECS cluster and services
- RDS database
- ElastiCache Redis
- Application Load Balancer
- CloudWatch monitoring

## Security Considerations

### âœ… Implemented

- Non-root user in containers
- Minimal base images
- Environment variable management
- Health checks

### ðŸ”„ Planned for Production

- AWS Secrets Manager for credentials
- VPC with private subnets
- Security groups with minimal access
- WAF for API protection
- SSL/TLS termination
- IAM roles with least privilege

## Monitoring and Observability

### âœ… Ready

- Health check endpoints
- Structured logging
- Docker container monitoring

### ðŸ”„ Planned

- CloudWatch Logs integration
- Application metrics
- Error tracking (Sentry)
- Performance monitoring
- Alerting and notifications

## Scaling Strategy

### Horizontal Scaling

- ECS Fargate auto-scaling
- Load balancer distribution
- Database read replicas
- Redis cluster mode

### Vertical Scaling

- CPU and memory allocation
- Database instance sizing
- Connection pooling

## Cost Optimization

### Development

- Local Docker containers
- No AWS costs during development

### Production

- ECS Fargate (pay per task)
- RDS reserved instances
- ElastiCache reserved nodes
- CloudWatch basic monitoring

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup

1. Create AWS account and IAM roles
2. Set up VPC and networking
3. Create ECR repository
4. Configure Secrets Manager

### Phase 2: Database Migration

1. Create RDS PostgreSQL instance
2. Run Alembic migrations
3. Seed production data
4. Update connection strings

### Phase 3: Application Deployment

1. Build and push Docker image
2. Create ECS cluster and service
3. Configure load balancer
4. Set up monitoring

### Phase 4: Go Live

1. DNS configuration
2. SSL certificate setup
3. Performance testing
4. Monitoring validation

## Development Workflow

### Local Development

```bash
# Start production-like environment
./scripts/start-prod.sh

# Test locally
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

### Pre-production Testing

```bash
# Deploy to staging
./infrastructure/aws/deploy.sh --environment staging

# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration
```

### Production Deployment

```bash
# Deploy to production
./infrastructure/aws/deploy.sh --environment production

# Monitor deployment
aws ecs wait services-stable --cluster migrate-cluster --services migrate-backend-service
```

## Rollback Strategy

### Quick Rollback

- ECS service rollback to previous task definition
- Database point-in-time recovery
- DNS failover to backup region

### Blue-Green Deployment

- Deploy new version alongside current
- Switch traffic when validated
- Keep old version for quick rollback

## Disaster Recovery

### Backup Strategy

- RDS automated backups
- ECR image versioning
- Configuration in version control
- Secrets in AWS Secrets Manager

### Recovery Plan

- Multi-AZ deployment
- Cross-region replication
- Automated failover procedures
- Data recovery procedures

## Performance Optimization

### Application Level

- Database connection pooling
- Redis caching
- Async request handling
- Response compression

### Infrastructure Level

- CDN for static assets
- Load balancer optimization
- Database query optimization
- Container resource tuning

## Compliance and Governance

### Security

- SOC 2 compliance preparation
- Regular security audits
- Vulnerability scanning
- Access control reviews

### Data Protection

- GDPR compliance
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Audit logging
- Data retention policies

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Week 1-2)

1. Set up AWS account and basic infrastructure
2. Create ECR repository and push first image
3. Deploy to staging environment
4. Configure basic monitoring

### Short Term (Week 3-4)

2. Set up disaster recovery
3. Security hardening
4. Cost optimization

### Long Term (Month 3+)

1. Multi-region deployment
2. Advanced scaling features
3. Compliance certification
4. Advanced analytics

## Conclusion

Our current Docker-based development environment provides an excellent foundation for AWS deployment. The production-ready setup ensures smooth transitions from development to production while maintaining security, scalability, and reliability.

The containerized approach allows us to:

- Maintain consistency between environments
- Scale efficiently
- Deploy quickly and safely
- Monitor effectively
- Recover from failures

This strategy positions us for successful production deployment with minimal risk and maximum flexibility.
